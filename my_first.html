        <h1>HOW TO BE</h1>
        <P>
        My son, do not forget my teaching, 
        but keep my commands in your heart,
        For they will prolong your life many years
        and bring you peace and prosperity.
        Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
        bind them around your neck,
        write them on the tablet of your heart.
        Then you will win favor and a good name
        in the sight of God and man.
        Trust in the Lord with all your heart
        and lean not on your own understanding;
        in all your ways submit to Him,
        and He wii make your paths straight.
        D not be wise in your own eyes;
        fear the Lord and shun evil.
        This will bring health to your <body>
            and nourishment to your bones.
        </P>
